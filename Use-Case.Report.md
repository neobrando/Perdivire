# INTRODUCTION

In the world of software development, technology enthusiasts and professionals are constantly seeking innovative tools and platforms to streamline their processes and enhance collaboration. one of the most popular ones, GitHub is one of the best options regarding it’s performance transforming the way software is developed, shared, and managed. As a robust version control system and collaboration platform, GitHub revolutionizes the software development lifecycle, empowering developers and teams with unparalleled advantages and paving the way for seamless project management.
This essay delves into the realm of software development and explores the advantages of utilizing GitHub as an indispensable tool and how we implement it on a collaborative project. By examining the advantages and the methodology and commands used on GitHub, we uncover a host of benefits that accelerate productivity, foster collaboration, and foster innovation.


## Justification for Using GitHub

GitHub offers several compelling reasons for using it as a software maintenance tool for our project. GitHub provides robust version control features, allowing us to track changes made to our project over time. This ensures that we can easily revert to previous versions if necessary and collaborate effectively as a team.
GitHub makes collaboration easier among team members. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, resolving conflicts using and merging changes efficiently.

## Justification for Using Trello

Trello is the project management tool chosen for our project due to the following advantages:
Trello provides a visual and intuitive workflow system using boards, lists, and cards. This enables us to organize tasks, track progress, and visualize the overall project status easily.
We can create custom labels, add attachments, set due dates, and assign team members to tasks, tailoring the tool to our project management requirements.
Team members can comment on cards, mention others, and attach relevant files or links.
Trello could be integrated with various other tools and services. We can connect Trello with GitHub, Slack, and other popular development tools, enabling efficient communication and data synchronization across different platforms.

# Methodology:

## Method for creating a management environment for the tool you will be using. 

- Step 1: Access Trello
Go to Trello in your favorite web browser. If you don't have an account, sign up for free.

- Step 2: Create a new board
Once you are logged in, click the "Create" button at the top right of the screen. Select "Dashboard" from the dropdown menu.

- Step 3: Name your board
Assign a descriptive name for your board. For example, you can use the name of the project you are working on. Then click "Create Board."

- Step 4: Configure the lists
Lists in Trello help you organize tasks. Click the "Add a List" button on the right side of your board. Give it a relevant name, for example "To-dos", and press Enter to create it. Repeat this step to create as many lists as you need.

- Step 5: Add cards to lists
The cards represent the individual tasks within each list. Click "Add a card" in the corresponding list and type the title of the task. Press Enter to create the card. Repeat this step for all the cards you want to add.

- Step 6: Personalize your cards
You can click on any card to open it and add more details. You can assign a responsible team member, set deadlines, add descriptions and comments, and attach relevant files.

- Step 7: Create tags (optional)
If you want to categorize your tasks, you can create tags. To do this, click the "Labels" button on the right side of a card and select "Create Label". Give it a name and color and click "Save."

## Step-by-step process of uploading your project to Github

- Create a GitHub Repository: Sign in to GitHub and navigate to the main page. Click on the "New" button to create a new repository. Provide a repository name, description, and choose appropriate settings (public or private).

- Add remote origin:To add a new remote repository, use the 'git remote add origin' command in the terminal, inside the directory where your repository is stored.
 'git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY.git'
The address after the word origin is according to the repository previously created.

- Add Project Files: Place all the relevant project files within the repository directory on your local machine. Use the 'git add <file>' command to stage the files for commit.

- Commit Changes: Commit the changes using the git commit -m "Commit message" command. It is good practice to provide a descriptive commit message that summarizes the changes made.

- Push to GitHub: Push the committed changes to the GitHub repository using the git push command. This will upload the project files to the remote repository on GitHub.

We got to use what was trello and github and the truth is that it is something very comfortable to use github it is easy to understand aside it is easy that we can see the changes that are made in the code despite the fact that each one of the team He did something different, we were able to complement each other in a comfortable way since I consider github to be a good option to use. and we use what is trello. I feel that, like github, it felt very comfortable to use since they could visualize what each member is doing, how progress is being made and depending on what is being done and how long it takes to dictate their support will be needed or not so it can be said that I felt that progress was very easy thanks to the use of these tools
 
 ## Santacruz Estrada
Using Github to host our repository helps us keep track of the project. Making easy to access and review previous changes and versions. Github also allow us to work in an interesting way as a team. Each member can be working in different task without affecting each other which can be done through the use of branches. Trello help us to have a visual environment to visualize what is needed to be done, what is being doing, how is the progress of our partners, and so on. Based on the above, this tools - Trello and Github - are useful when performing the mainteinence of the project.
 
 ## Serrato Contreras
Overall, the combination of Trello and GitHub provides a comprehensive project management and version control solution. Trello enables task organization, collaboration, and workflow visualization, while GitHub ensures code versioning, collaboration, and code quality control. By leveraging both platforms, software development teams can enhance productivity, streamline communication, and deliver high-quality software projects efficiently.
